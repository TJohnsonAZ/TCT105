The penguins of Madagascar likely represent the military industry. Skipper is leader, driven by the thirst for power and authority, exerting overbearing control over the others. Private represents fresh recruits, driven by either patriotism or having no other output in life. In the movie he was born without parents, as he was saved by the 3 other penguins. His whole life, he has known nothing but being under constant authority to those who consider themselves superior. Kawalski represent those in the field of science or technology, selling out to the military industrial complex, objecting at first of course but nevertheless adhering to the benefit of profit. Rico is mindless terror. His lack of compassion and pure psychopathy represents those who have been transformed by war, the soldierâ€™s who entire purpose is centered around his military service. He becomes violent and unable to communicate, only knowing to harm and destroy. He is perhaps a symbol for what private will become.
